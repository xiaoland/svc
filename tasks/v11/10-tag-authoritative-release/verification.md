# Verification Matrix

## Source and Policy

| ID | Proof | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REL-001 | Tag grammar and identity | Only strict unused `vX.Y.Z` refs that peel to exactly one commit are accepted; lightweight and annotated tags have identical meaning, and annotation/signature metadata grants no authority |
| REL-002 | Main reachability | Branch-only, deleted-history, or mismatched tag commits fail before build |
| REL-003 | Monotonic version | Equal, reused, or regressive versions fail before mutation |
| REL-004 | Exact impact | Tag is the exact next single bump required by the maximum Behavioral SemVer impact since the previous release |
| REL-005 | Release-none eligibility | Under protected admission, a tag window with no new fragments remains publishable at the next patch version and contributes no reason |
| REL-006 | Migration guidance | Every added MAJOR fragment has a same-slug non-empty packaged migration note containing steps or an explicit non-applicability explanation |
| REL-007 | No source preparation | Release rehearsal leaves `git status` and tracked file hashes unchanged |
| REL-008 | Append-only fragments | A post-cutover fragment modification, rename, deletion, or path reuse fails qualification |
| REL-009 | Deterministic notes | The same previous tag, candidate tag, and source tree produce byte-identical release metadata and notes |

## Version and Build Projection

| ID | Proof | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REL-010 | One version authority | Tag, sdist/wheel metadata, installed CLI, catalog, filenames, bundle, and Release title agree |
| REL-011 | Lock discipline | `pdm lock --check` passes and release uses frozen dependency groups |
| REL-012 | Full qualification | Python 3.11/3.14 tests, Ruff, mypy, Import Linter, zizmor, monolith, and release planner pass |
| REL-013 | Exact wheel smoke | Fresh venv installs the produced wheel and exercises `svc --help`, lookup, init, and status |
| REL-014 | Artifact contents | Migration/catalog/resources exist; tasks, tests, native telemetry, and quality dependencies do not enter wheel metadata |
| REL-015 | Immutable promotion | One tag-time producer builds both distributions; every later job and recovery path consumes the same manifest-bound bytes without rebuild, using the current exact-tag control verifier rather than artifact-provided code |
| REL-016 | Build cleanliness | No generated version, notes, metadata, or catalog projection mutates the source checkout |
| REL-017 | Sdist round trip | Building a wheel from the produced sdist without Git or a version override preserves exact release version and catalog identity |
| REL-018 | No legacy authority | No release/build/runtime path reads `src/manifest.json`, a static project version, or CHANGELOG as release eligibility or version input |
| REL-019 | Completed predecessor | Candidate build is blocked unless its immediate prior strict tag is the verified v11.0.0 cutover baseline or an exact-complete target-model release |

## Workflow Topology

| ID | Proof | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REL-020 | Normal trigger and single writer | One `v*` tag push starts Publish automatically; all tags/recoveries share one repository-wide concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress: false` |
| REL-021 | No alternate normal path | No release PR, automatic tag, branch push, or normal-path dispatch can publish |
| REL-022 | Build once | One job creates distributions and every downstream job consumes the same checked bundle |
| REL-023 | Publication order | After any subset upload, bounded PyPI filename/hash readback must reach all-exact before GitHub Release creation |
| REL-024 | Fail-closed finalizer | Normal create enumerates manifest assets and includes `--verify-tag`, exact title/notes, and no `--draft`; readback resolves the remote tag object (not `target_commitish`); only 404/verified exact draft states may mutate |
| REL-025 | Explicit recovery | Dispatch probes before build: empty state may rebuild without a run ID; exact-complete state may verify durable Release assets and succeed; any incomplete PyPI/GitHub state requires the exact prior-run bundle, which a current exact-tag verifier must prove semantically equal to the fresh plan except for its qualification proof |
| REL-026 | No mutable-main dependency | Retry succeeds after later `main` changes using only the tag and preserved bundle |
| REL-027 | Bounded bundle retention and provenance | Upload declares `retention-days: 90`; API readback records ID/`expires_at` and at least an 89-day effective window. Before download, recovery binds the supplied run ID to the Publish workflow path, allowed trigger, planned head SHA, terminal state, and one exact named artifact; expiry, early deletion, run deletion, or provenance mismatch blocks incomplete recovery rather than rebuilding |
| REL-028 | Legacy path extinction | No workflow or release command can prepare source, consume/delete fragments, update CHANGELOG, run Towncrier, create a release PR, or create a tag automatically |
| REL-029 | Hash-aware idempotence | PyPI or draft exact subsets receive only missing original files; PyPI is re-read all-exact; exact published state succeeds; unexpected names, metadata/hash mismatch, published partials, and ambiguity fail closed |

## Repository Enforcement

| ID | Proof | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REL-030 | Protected main | GitHub API reports PR-required admission, required checks, no force-push/deletion, and explicit bypass policy |
| REL-031 | Required checks | Merge is blocked when any trusted qualification check fails or is absent |
| REL-032 | Exact main result | The admitted commit/tree receives the shared qualification result before release |
| REL-033 | Immutable release tags | GitHub API reports matching `v*` tags cannot be updated or deleted |
| REL-034 | Authorized tag creation | The intended maintainer path can create a new tag without granting workflow-wide write authority |
| REL-035 | Publisher identity | `release` environment and PyPI Trusted Publisher bind only the intended repository/workflow/environment, and its sole custom deployment policy is `type: tag, name: v*` |
| REL-036 | Sole approval | The authorized protected tag is the only human release action; the `release` environment has no required reviewer and no path can abandon a tag for a newer release |
| REL-037 | Immutable GitHub Release | Repository release immutability is enabled before cutover, and the completed Release API reports exact assets plus `immutable: true` |

## Planned Proof Owners

| Range | Primary proof owner |
| --- | --- |
| REL-001–REL-009 | `tests/test_release.py` fixture repositories, notes snapshots, and source-cleanliness assertions |
| REL-010–REL-019 | `tests/test_release.py`, `tests/test_catalog.py`, source-resource tests, negative legacy-authority assertions, and the shared distribution/sdist smoke |
| REL-020–REL-029 | `tests/test_workflows.py`, static legacy-path assertions, and hermetic bundle/draft/PyPI state fixtures |
| REL-030–REL-037 | GitHub API readback, `tests/test_workflows.py`, and one blocked probe PR |
| First production tag | Publish run, PyPI JSON, GitHub Release API, and bundle-hash evidence |

Each implementation slice must name the exact tests or external observations
from these owner groups before mutation.

## Hermetic Histories

Fixture repositories cover:

1. one patch fragment;
2. mixed patch/minor fragments;
3. a MAJOR fragment with guide;
4. a MAJOR fragment with explicit non-applicability;
5. one `release:none` commit after a published tag;
6. a fragment modification, rename, deletion, and globally reused path;
7. multiple unreleased commits and an older main ancestor tag;
8. a tag on a branch-only commit;
9. equivalent lightweight, unsigned annotated, and signed annotated tags, plus
   rejection of a tag ref that does not peel to a commit;
10. reused tag, reused version, over/under-bump, malformed tag, and source race;
11. wheel-from-sdist construction without Git or a version override;
12. named-bundle recovery after later `main` changes but before artifact
    expiry;
13. dispatch without a prior-run ID against empty, exact-complete, and
    incomplete PyPI/GitHub states;
14. PyPI none, exact-subset → upload → bounded all-exact readback, all-exact,
    stale readback timeout, unexpected-name, and mismatched-hash states;
15. GitHub absent, exact draft-subset, wrong tag/commit/title/notes with exact
    assets, a benign `target_commitish: main` with an exact remote tag object,
    published-exact, published-partial, mismatched, and ambiguous states;
16. a recovery canary whose later `main` would produce different bytes, proving
    that no build command or source projection runs;
17. expired, early-deleted artifact, and deleted-run states after simulated
    external mutation, proving that recovery blocks rather than rebuilding;
18. two candidate tags and one recovery attempt, proving global
    serialization, completed-predecessor gating (independent of expired
    completed-run artifacts), and non-cancellation.
19. a recovered bundle with an altered `release-check.py`, a mismatched
    workflow path/head SHA, or an uncompleted prior run, proving the current
    control verifier rejects it before any artifact-provided program can run.

## Local Implementation Evidence — 2026-07-29

- `pdm run test`: 226 passed.
- `pdm lock --check`, `pdm run lint-tests`, `pdm run typecheck`,
  `pdm run lint-imports`, `pdm run lint-workflows`, and
  `pdm run build-monolith`: passed.
- `PDM_BUILD_SCM_VERSION=11.0.1 pdm build` produced exactly one wheel and one
  sdist; their core metadata and packaged catalog agreed on `11.0.1`.
- Fresh installed-wheel smoke (`--help`, lookup, init, and status) passed
  locally, on `wsl.win-ws.localhost` with Python 3.13, and on
  `win-ws.localhost` with Python 3.14. Remote temporary test directories were
  removed after verification.

These are local/static proofs only. The authorized GitHub-control mutation and
API readback now satisfy REL-030 through REL-037's control portion; the first
real tag still supplies the Publish/PyPI/Release proof.

## Live Acceptance

Before merge:

- local full matrix passes;
- PR required checks are green;
- a read-only workflow/repository settings audit matches the intended payload.

Before repository-rule mutation:

- exact-main CI passes with stable check names;
- no release workflow or tag is created by the merge;
- the proposed rule payload names only observed checks from the GitHub Actions
  app.

After rule activation but before the hard cut:

- API and environment readback satisfies REL-030 through REL-037;
- a deliberately failing probe PR is blocked without merging;
- the old prepared-source release remains the only production path.

Observed on 2026-07-30: all target contexts completed successfully on bootstrap
main `fa478617f0898cdbcefcf8eef2717fbc7bb7bebb`; the main and tag rulesets,
release environment, and immutable-release setting read back exactly as
specified. Empty probe PR #17 deliberately failed `Release policy` in 14
seconds and was reported `BLOCKED`; it was closed and its remote branch deleted
without merging.

After the Slice 4 cut, the presence or successful invocation of
`release-pr.yml`, `release-tag.yml`, automatic tag creation, or a normal-path
Publish dispatch is a failed acceptance, not a tolerated compatibility path.
The cutover merge itself creates no tag, draft, PyPI file, or Release. No
direct production push or destructive tag probe is performed merely for
testing.

The first production tag requires separate explicit authorization. Its evidence
must record the tag, commit, workflow run, named artifact ID/expiry,
wheel/sdist hashes, PyPI post-upload readback, published immutable GitHub
Release metadata/assets, and preserved-bundle recovery outcome.
