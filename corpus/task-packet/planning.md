# Task Packet Planning Topology

Use this depth when a Task needs more control than one short linear Plan. It
defines shared management units, not a universal hierarchy. Every admitted
unit must lower planning, recovery, coordination, or integration cost compared
with leaving it implicit.

| Unit | Management meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Task** | the complete outcome obligation and packet boundary |
| **Track** | a persistent concern or obligation axis that may advance across several barriers |
| **Phase** | a real shared barrier across an explicitly declared set of Tracks |
| **Cell** | one Track's obligation inside one Phase; the local Plan owner when both axes exist |
| **Plan** | one linear, partial route owned by the Task, a Cell, or another bounded unit |
| **Slice** | an ordered Plan return with a meaningful integration boundary |
| **Step** | a concrete action inside a Slice |
| **Assignment** | bounded work placed with an actor or mechanism; not another planning level |

Track and Phase are optional Task axes. Track preserves concern continuity;
Phase exists only when a shared barrier materially coordinates named Tracks.
A Phase's scope may omit unaffected Tracks. It exits only when every required
Cell in that scope satisfies its obligation; never manufacture a barrier or
empty Cell for matrix symmetry. Refer to a Cell as `<track>-<phase>` or another
declared unambiguous handle.

A small Task may own one Task Plan. Retire that single Plan when Track or Phase
topology makes the Task non-linear; each admitted Cell or bounded owner then
holds its own linear Plan. Allow one Plan by default and multiple Plans only
when their effects or feedback are independently controllable and their
integration relation is explicit.

A Plan is honest about limited foresight. State the current route, ordered
Slices, and a to-be-continued condition where later work depends on evidence
or feedback not yet available. Slice identity is globally ordered within its
Plan; an optional return tag follows the number, for example `01-IQ`, `02-DS`,
`03-IM`, or `04-VR`. The tag describes what the Slice returns, not how every
Step works and not a separate numbering sequence.

Use relations such as `blocks`, `consumes`, `invalidates`, `integrates into`,
or `waits for` only when they change control. Coordination is this relation
view of work topology; it does not require a separate coordination object.
